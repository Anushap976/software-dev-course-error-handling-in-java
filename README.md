# Error Handling in Java

The exercises in this project are designed to help you understand error
handling in Java.

## Getting Started

To get started, open the project file located in
`error-handling-in-java/pom.xml` in IntelliJ.

## Project Overview 

This project contains a `Main` class that contains several methods that
demonstrate various aspects of error handling in Java.  There is one other
supporting classes in the project:

1. The `CustomDivideByZeroException` class is a custom exception that is thrown
   when a division by zero is attempted. *You **WILL** need to modify this
   class.*

The `ExerciseTests` class contains tests for the `Main` class.

## Exercise

To complete this exercise, you will need to follow the `TODO` comments in the
`Main` class and the `CustomDivideByZeroException` class.

## Running the Tests

As always, final verification of your code should be done by running the unit
tests.

To run the tests, right-click on the `test/java/org.example/src/ExerciseTests`
class and select "Run 'ExercisesTests'". This will run all of the tests for
the exercises. When a test succeeds, you will see a green checkmark next to
the test. When a test fails, you will see a red X next to the test.  Once all
of the tests pass, you have completed the exercises.
